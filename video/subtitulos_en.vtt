00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.270
Classical music playing softly in the background

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.000
Right now, at this very moment, as you watch these
light rays striking the magnified eye,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.000
similar tiny beams of light are entering your own eyes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And it's by our eyes that we are able to
gain a great part of our knowledge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.300
Nature has located the eye close to the brain
so that its messages may arrive there quickly.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.000
Nature has also provided ample protection,
for this very delicate organ.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here, with the outer coverings removed, we see the
eyeball completely surrounded by a layer of soft,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
fatty tissue and placed within the bony orbit
where it lies protected against sudden jolts.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Seen from the side, the protected position of
the eyeball within its funnel-shaped eye socket

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.300
is shown still more clearly.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.000
Once again, we see the fatty cushion
which protects it on all sides.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Note this white stalk, which is the optic nerve,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and also these muscles which move the eyeball.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is the empty eye socket within the skull
with its bony walls inside

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the rim of the bony orbit in front.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
By gradually restoring the outer portions of the skull
and also the covering tissues,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we can now realize the location of the entire eye
in relation to the outline of the face.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Another important safeguard to the eye is the
tear gland, which secretes the tear fluid.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is an effective germicide which drains
through the tear ducts into the nose

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
after flushing and cleaning the entire eye surface.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The eyeball itself has a white, glistening surface.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Its front part bulges and forms a highly transparent window.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In this sectional view, the capsule of the
eyeball is seen to have three layers.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This thick, tough outer layer is called the sclera
and serves to protect the delicate structures within.
